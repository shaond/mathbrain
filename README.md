Math Brain
==========

Math Brain is a site that allows you to test yourself against a timer. 

We've figured that sitting exam papers isn't just about rocking the questions, 
its also about making sure that you can get your exam technique down pat. 

So we built an exam timer application that allows you to do just that.

We'd love to have someone to continue hacking at this idea and build a portal of their own (better than what we've got here:
